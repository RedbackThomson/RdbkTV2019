This redesign included developing the entire website on a React base, connecting to our MongoDB database through the Express server. The project included a working application and profile feature set for users, an administration back-end for organisers and a resume portal for corporate sponsors. Web Design was done by Vincent Liaw, and all development done by myself.",
